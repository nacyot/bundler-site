%h2#disable-multisource Enforce Source Hijacking Protection

    .description
      %p
        If a <code>Gemfile</code> <em>does</em> have multiple top-level gem
        sources, <code>bundle install</code> warns when a gem is found in more
        than one source. Setting <code>config disable_multisource</code> turns
        this warning into an error.

%h2#all-sources Improved gem lookup

      %p
        Gems are now looked up across all sources to satisfy dependencies. In addition, installed gems are now also looked up in remote sources.

%h2#install-and-package-improvements New options for <code>bundle package</code>

.contents

    .description
      %p
        You can now pass the <code>--no-install</code> flag to <code>bundle package</code> in order to update the gem cache, but not actually install gems. <code>bundle package</code> also takes a new <code>--all-platforms</code>, enabling caching of gem files for platforms other than the one bundler is run on. This solves some problems when deploying on a platform that is different from the development platform.

%h2#new-gem-improvements Improved templates for new Gems

.contents
  .bullet
    .description
      %p
        Creating new gems now includes more metadata in the template, sets the version appropriately, adds a gem code of conduct file, license setting and appropriate config options.
